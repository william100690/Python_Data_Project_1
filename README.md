# Integral and Evolutive project

The purpose of this project is to strengthen the use and knowledge of the Python programming language by utilizing its different functions and iterators, creating simple functions and lambda functions. 

On the other hand, we will also make use of the Pandas library to extract, manipulate and transform information from different datasets. For this project, we have datasets from streaming platforms such as Amazon, Disney, Hulu, and Netflix.

What is required for this project is the cleaning of the data from the given datasets, their concatenation for the creation of a unique and clean table, and the execution of some queries.

As a to-do list, we can enumerate the following:

1. Loading of the different datasets. I recommend exploring them before loading them into Pandas. Additionally, I suggest performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on each dataset and applying whatever is necessary before concatenating them.

2. Create an ID. This is left to the imagination of each individual.

3. Observe null values, verify and assess if they can be completed, inferred, or deleted.

4. Perform the specific queries requested. As a plus, you can create a function that automates the query so that only the variables need to be entered. As an extra point, you can create a class that contains all the query functions and is activated by a user menu.


A)  Quantity of movies by platform

B) Top 3 directors that has the most quantity of movies by platform

C) Top 3 movies with maximun duration by platform

D) Top 3 actors with more movies by platfomr

5. Create a PowerBi dash board to present the information
